# How to complete this Code Adventure!

In this workspace, you'll find a file that contains four sections: 
the description, the code, the output, and the tests.

### Purpose
The purpose of a code adventure is practice, repitition,
and to get you to think about how you would implement
your own algorithm. Except in a code adventure
we will attempt to tackle more "low-level"
like approaches, avoiding all the more
"magical" high-level language features
that Python has built into it. 

### The description
Read the description at the top of the `code.py` file to understand
the details of the problem for this code adventure.

### The code
Below the description, there may be some pre-written code. Look for
the `# add your code here` comments. These are where you will
be filling in all your bits of code to complete the code adventure.

Note: We encourage you to use the most explicit
and verbose way you can for writing it out. You 
should try to avoid using any other built-ins functions
that do most of the work for you and really be 
trying to use the foundations of the language.

This means things like: 
 - Setting variables
 - Built-in datatypes: 
    List, Tuple, Dict, Set, Class, Integer, String, Float...
 - Loops (for or while)
 - Conditional if statements
 - Using Comparison operators ( ==, !=, >=, <=, <>, is, is not)
 - Using Logical operators ( AND, OR, NOT  )
 - Using Numeric operators ( +, -, *, /, //, %)
 - Using Bitwise operators (&, ^, |, <<, >>, ~x)
 - str(), int(), float() for converting types into other types.

(definitely use these where you see fit)

### The output
Below the function, a few `print` statements have been included 
to print the output of the function. Feel free to change the input
of your function here to help you debug. 

### The tests 
(**Do not change any code in the tests section**)
These `if` statements will "test" the return of your function 
to let you know if your function meets all the criteria of a correct answer. 
When you're ready to test your function, go to the console below 
the code editor (you can open the console by selecting "show console" 
in the view menu if the console is closed) and enter

```python test.py```

The output will tell you which tests passed and which ones failed.
When all the tests pass, you have a working solution! Keep an eye
on Slack because we will have a day in which we post solutions in 
the [#code-adventures](https://treehouse-python-td.slack.com/messages/C9564GYV7) 
channel and compare your solution with other students so please DO NOT immediately post solutions.
